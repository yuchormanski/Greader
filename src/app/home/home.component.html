            For better mental health, read a book. Studies show a range of
            psychological benefits from book-reading. Reading fiction can
            increase your capacity for empathy, through the process of seeing
            the world through a relatable character. Reading has been found to
            reduce stress as effectively as yoga. It is being prescribed for
            depression â€“ a treatment known as bibliotherapy.
