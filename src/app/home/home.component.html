              For better mental health, read a book. Studies show a range of
              psychological benefits from book-reading. Reading fiction can
              increase your capacity for empathy, through the process of seeing
              the world through a relatable character. Reading has been found to
              reduce stress as effectively as yoga. It is being prescribed for
              depression â€“ a treatment known as bibliotherapy.
